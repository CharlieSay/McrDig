## CSS Exercise

We're going to style our news page. My finished page like this:

![Finished news page](css.png)

You'll want to create a new CSS file (I've called mine `main.css`) in the same folder as your `index.html` file, and you'll need to include it in with a `link` tag:

```html
<head>
  ...
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="main.css" type="text/css">
</head>
```

Then add styles to your different HTML elements (I'd advise starting from the outside and working your way in). Discuss with the person next to you if you're unsure (or just to see what they're doing!).

You can see my finished page [here](https://mcrcodes.github.io/newspage/). You can use the Chrome Developer Tools to inspect each element on the page (may also be helpful if you didn't finish the HTML exercise). You can find the repository [here](https://github.com/MCRcodes/mcrcodes.github.io/tree/master/newspage).
